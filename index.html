<div id="poem"><a>before covid i thought i was one bad date away from falling in love <br> <br>

From halfway up <br>
the city looks like a collection of matchstick houses.<br>
I carry the smell of Pennsylvania barbecues <br>
and regrettable anecdotes about bad tinder dates. <br>

Jess throws a party on sunday. She says <br>
I know the world is collapsing in on itself or whatever<br>
but there's still cheap gin to buy<br>

I stand between an acne prone wall and someone else's inside joke.<br>
I let my mouth sit hollow and jagged.<br>
I cover the sharpened edge of a boy's unwanted tongue<br>
with stories of the last time I threw up.<br>

The rest is just ruthless jello shots<br>
and dim lighting.  A monochrome game<br>
of never have I ever and tolerated dry contacts.<br>

But then Olivia smiles at me.<br>
I watch myself clink wine glasses<br>
and stream reality tv.<br>
I let the 2am lamplight drip onto my hands.<br>
The sky is cross-stitched tangerine.<br>
Like my heart spills a greedy egg yolk.<br>

After all of this my palm is still asking to be held softer<br>
Instead of gripped like a ribeye steak.<br>
Maybe this is the last time I will look for the margin of my body<br>
and settle for a swollen hunger.  Where I define myself<br>
as relational to whatever jagger soaked man I am closest to.<br>

I can move into that cottage<br>
and stop thinking about stripping naked on stage.<br>
I can have a reasonable skincare routine.<br>
I can be more bearable.<br>

On my last night in Bath I danced<br>
drunken and moon eyed on my back porch.<br>
I thought this is the type of<br>
girl I could fall in love with.<br>

<div id='question'><a>how drunk are you?</a></div>

  <div id='link1'><a href='https://queerspaces.github.io/club/' style="color:#abf5f4">like a swollen piece of glass</a></div>

  <div id='link2'><a href='https://queerspaces.github.io/body/' style="color:#efabf5">only enough to percieve myself a disheartening amount</a></div>
